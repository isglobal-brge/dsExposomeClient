\usage{
ds.exwas(
  model,
  Set,
  family,
  type = c("pooled", "meta"),
  exposures_family = NULL,
  adjust.by.study = FALSE,
  tef = TRUE,
  datasources = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{\code{character} Formula, not including exposures, to be tested.}

\item{Set}{\code{character} Name of the Exposome Set object on the server side}

\item{family}{\code{character} Nature of the health outcome (\code{gaussian}, \code{binomial} or \code{poisson})}

\item{type}{\code{character} Type of analysis to be performed. \code{"pooled"} to perform a pooled analysis 
as if all the data was present on the same dataset, \code{"meta"} to perform an ExWAS on every 
study server to later meta-analyse the results.}

\item{exposures_family}{\code{character} (default \code{NULL}) Family to subset the ExposomeSet, only the exposures of the 
selected family will be used for the ExWAS analysis.}

\item{adjust.by.study}{\code{bool} (default \code{FALSE}) Option to adjust the linear models by cohort, 
this only applies to \code{type = "pooled"}, there is no need to have a specific variable on the ExposomeSets 
that has the cohort code. The translation to typical glm syntaxis is \code{objective_variable ~ covariates + cohort} 
(IMPORTANT to note that there is no need to change your \code{model} argument of the \code{ds.exwas()} function).}

\item{tef}{\code{bool} If \code{TRUE} computes the threshold for effective tests.}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link{DSConnection-class}} objects obtained after login}
}
\value{
For \code{type='pooled'}: \code{list} that contains: \cr
- exwas_results: \code{data.frame} with exposure name, coefficient and p-value of the association \cr
- alpha_corrected: \code{numeric} effective tests \cr
For \code{type='meta'}: A \code{list} of \code{list} with the elements from \code{type='pooled'}.
}
\description{
Takes as input an Exposome Set object on the study server and performs a 
ExWAS association study with the provided model.
